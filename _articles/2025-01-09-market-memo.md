# Investment Research Memo
**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** Senior Desk Analyst
**Date:** January 9, 2026
**Subject:** The "Rising Wedge Overthrow," Payroll Revision Shock & The January 14th Catalyst

---

### 1. Executive Summary
* **Market Bias:** **STRONGLY BEARISH** (Topping process entering final "Overthrow" phase).
* **The Core Thesis:** The S&P 500 (`$SPX`) is executing a textbook **"Rising Wedge Overthrow"**, a fractal replica of the January 2022 top. While the index has pushed **0.85%** above its October peak, it is diverging from `$NDX` and slamming into massive resistance at the **7,000** level. The analyst argues the market is "topping on good news" (strong GDP estimates) while ignoring catastrophic downward revisions to labor data (October revised to **-173,000** jobs).
* **Key Risk/Warning:** **The January 14th "Double Barrel" Catalyst.** The Supreme Court delayed its tariff ruling, with the next decision day likely **Wednesday, Jan 14**, coinciding with PPI data. A ruling against the administration (75% probability per betting markets) combined with rising inflation could trigger "financial chaos" and a spike in yields.

---

### 2. The 'Alpha' Logic (The Fractal Driver)
**Framework:** **The "1.5% Overthrow" Rule & Labor Market Divergence.**

* **The 2022 Fractal Target:**
    * **The Rule:** In the 2022 top, the S&P 500 broke out and rallied exactly **1.5%** above its previous peak before collapsing.
    * **Current Status:** We are currently **0.85%** above the October/Christmas high.
    * **The Trade:** This implies the market has "room" for a final **~0.65% squeeze** early next week. This would push `$SPX` just above **7,000**, tagging the upper Weekly Channel Line and the Upper Bollinger Band to complete the trap.
* **The "Shadow" Recession Mechanism:**
    * The analyst identifies a "Top on Good News" phenomenon. The Atlanta Fed is predicting **5.1% GDP** for Q4 (similar to 2007 highs), yet job growth is negative when factoring in revisions. This disconnect historically precedes major crashes (2000, 2008).

### 3. Technical Analysis & Trade Setups

#### **`$SPX` (S&P 500)**
* **Price Action:** Closed at a new high (6965+), nearing the **7,000** psychological level.
* **The Setup:** **Rising Wedge Overthrow / Triple Negative Divergence.**
*

* **Analysis:**
    * **Triple Divergence:** RSI, MACD, and Price Oscillator are making lower highs while price makes higher highs on both Daily and Weekly timeframes.
    * **Bollinger Band:** The Upper Band is sitting just below 7,000. Past tags of this band have led to immediate reversals.
    * **Ending Diagonal:** The price action resembles an Elliott Wave "Ending Diagonal" (overlapping waves), signaling trend exhaustion.
* **Target:** **7,000 - 7,050** (Upper Channel Line).
* **Verdict:** **Short the 7,000 Overthrow.**

#### **`$NDX` (Nasdaq 100)**
* **Price Action:** Lagging significantly. Failed to make a new high vs. October 29.
* **The Setup:** **Gap Fill Trap.**
* **Analysis:**
    * While `$SPX` pushes to 7,000, `$NDX` has a massive **overhead gap** left from the recent drop.
    * **Scenario:** `$NDX` likely rallies early next week to **fill this gap** (but stay below the Oct highs), creating a perfect "Lower High" divergence relative to `$SPX`.
* **Verdict:** **Short the Gap Fill.**

#### **`$US10Y` & `$US30Y` (Treasury Yields)**
* **Price Action:** 30-Year dropped slightly but the breakout structure remains.
* **The Setup:** **Inverse Head & Shoulders.**
*

* **Analysis:**
    * Yields have bottomed. The analyst predicts a spike driven by **Supreme Court "Refund" Panic** (deficit blowout) or **Inflation Reigniting** (CPI next week).
* **Verdict:** **Bullish Yields** (Bearish Bonds/Equities).

#### **`$BTC` (Bitcoin)**
* **Price Action:** Down 36% from highs; currently consolidating.
* **The Setup:** **Bear Flag / Catch-Up Play.**
* **Analysis:**
    * Bitcoin is the "lead-lag" indicator. It peaked first (like 2021) and has already crashed 36%.
    * The S&P 500 is currently "going sideways" (distributing) just like it did in early 2022 while BTC dropped. Once `$SPX` tops, BTC gets its "Second Leg Down" to the **April Lows**.
* **Verdict:** **Bearish.**

### 4. Macro & Fundamental Drivers
* **The "Feeble" Labor Market (Critical Revisions):**
    * **Headline:** Dec Non-Farm Payrolls +50k (Miss vs 73k).
    * **The "Real" Data (Revisions):**
        * **October:** Slashed from -105k to **-173,000** (Massive deterioration).
        * **August:** Revised to **-6,000**.
        * **June:** Revised to **-13,000**.
    * **Implication:** We have had **3 months of negative job growth** in the last half-year. The "Recession" is already here in the data.
* **Catalyst Calendar (The "Danger Zone"):**
    * **Tue, Jan 13:** CPI Data. (Expectation: Core YoY ticks *up* to 2.7%).
    * **Wed, Jan 14:** **Supreme Court Tariff Ruling** (High Probability) + PPI Data.
    * **Policy Outlook:** Fed Pause in January is 95% priced in (Rates 3.50-3.75%). Analyst expects "Jumbo Cuts" later in Q1/Q2 *only after* the panic sets in.

---

### 5. Scenarios & Invalidations
* **Bear Trigger (The Crash Sequence):**
    * **Step 1:** `$SPX` hits ~7,000 (1.5% extension).
    * **Step 2:** `$NDX` fills its overhead gap.
    * **Step 3:** Supreme Court rules Tariffs unconstitutional (Wed Jan 14).
    * **Confirmation:** Loss of the **10-Day Moving Average** on `$SPX`.
* **Bull Trigger (Invalidation):**
    * **`$SPX`:** A sustained weekly close *above* the 7,000 channel line (negating the wedge).
    * **`$NDX`:** Breaking above the **October 29 High** (erasing the divergence).

---

### 6. Glossary of Financial Jargon
* **Rising Wedge Overthrow:** A specific technical trap where price briefly exceeds the upper trendline of a bearish wedge pattern (to run stops/trap bulls) before violently reversing.
* **Ending Diagonal:** An Elliott Wave pattern shaped like a wedge, consisting of overlapping waves, occurring at the end of a major trend.
* **Polymarket:** A prediction market cited by the analyst; currently showing a **75% chance** the Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs.
* **Inverse Head & Shoulders:** A bullish reversal pattern (used here for Yields), suggesting the trend of falling rates is over and rates are heading higher.
