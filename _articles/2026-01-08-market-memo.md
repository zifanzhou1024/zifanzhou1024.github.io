# Investment Research Memo
**To:** Investment Committee
**From:** Senior Desk Analyst
**Date:** January 12, 2026
**Subject:** FED CRIMINAL PROBE, IRAN REVOLUTION & DOW THEORY DIVERGENCES

---

### 1. Executive Summary
* **Market Bias:** **BEARISH / HIGH ALERT**
* **The Core Thesis:** The market is facing a "Triple Threat" of catalysts this week (CPI, PPI, Supreme Court Tariff Ruling) while displaying classic late-cycle technical divergences. The analyst believes equities are "lagging" the Bitcoin bear market and will soon "catch up" to the downside, triggered by a potential spike in yields and a banking crisis stemming from Commercial Real Estate (CRE).
* **Key Risk/Warning:** **Systemic "Crack" in Bonds.** The analyst cites "Jamie Dimon's crack in the bond market" as the mechanism that will break CRE refinancing and spill over into a broader Banking Crisis.

---

### 2. The 'Alpha' Logic (The Speaker's Unique Angle)
**Framework:** **The "Catch-Up" Trade & Historical Lag Analysis.**

* **The "Bitcoin" Liquidity Gauge:**
    * **The Mechanism:** The analyst views `$BTC` as the leading liquidity indicator. Bitcoin has already confirmed a bear market and "second leg lower."
    * **Thesis:** `$SPX` and `$NDX` are living on borrowed time and must mechanically re-price lower to match crypto's liquidity contraction.
* **Dow Theory Divergence:**
    * **The Lag:** The analyst refutes the bullish "confirmation" of `$^DJT` making new highs. Historical crashes often occur shortly after `$DJI` and `$^DJT` diverge.
    * **Historical Context:** In 1987, the divergence lasted **7 trading days** before the crash. In 2018, it was **8 days**.
    * **Current Status:** We have a **1-day divergence** (Dow made a new high, Transports did not on that specific day). This small window is historically sufficient to precede a crash.

### 3. Technical Analysis & Trade Setups

#### **`$SPX` (S&P 500) & `$NDX` (Nasdaq 100)**
* **Price Action:** `$SPX` made a higher high, but `$NDX` remains below its Oct 29th peak (Inter-index divergence).
* **The Setup:** **Rising Wedge / Multiple Point Divergence.**
*

* **Analysis:**
    * **Rising Wedge** formation on Daily & 60-min charts.
    * **Gap and Trap:** Recent overnight gaps were filled intraday, suggesting distribution.
    * Multiple point divergences on RSI, MACD, and Price Oscillator.
* **Verdict:** **Short** on breakdown of the wedge trendline.

#### **`$DJI` (Dow Jones Industrial Average)**
* **Price Action:** Printed a new high today.
* **The Setup:** **Hanging Man Candlestick.**
*

* **Analysis:**
    * The new high formed a **Hanging Man** candle (bearish reversal signal).
    * Failed to be confirmed by `$^DJT` on the day (Short-term Dow Theory Divergence).
* **Verdict:** **Bearish Reversal** if followed by a lower close.

#### **`$NVDA` (Nvidia)**
* **The Setup:** **Head & Shoulders (Weekly).**
*

* **Analysis:**
    * Struggling at the 10-period SMA.
    * Potential Head and Shoulders top developing on the weekly timeframe.
    * **Downside Target:** If it breaks the 50-day SMA/Neckline, the target is the **200-week moving average**.
* **Verdict:** **High Alert.**

#### **`$US10Y` (10-Year Treasury Yield)**
* **The Setup:** **Inverse Head & Shoulders.**
* **Analysis:** The analyst projects yields to break out to new highs, driven by inflation re-acceleration or tariff uncertainty. Rising yields are the "kryptonite" for current valuations.
* **Verdict:** **Bullish Yields / Bearish Bonds.**

### 4. Macro & Fundamental Drivers
**The Catalyst Stack (Jan 13-14):**

1.  **Fed Governance Crisis:**
    * **Event:** Chair Powell reportedly under **criminal investigation** by DOJ regarding Fed building renovation.
    * **Details:** Project cost ballooned from $1.9B to $2.5–$3.0B ($600M+ over budget).
    * *Thesis:* Attacks on Fed independence introduce structural volatility.

2.  **Inflation Data (Tue/Wed):**
    * **CPI (Jan 13):** Expected Headline 2.7%; Core 2.8%.
    * *Risk:* A "hot" print spikes yields immediately.

3.  **Supreme Court Ruling (Jan 14):**
    * **Event:** Potential ruling on constitutionality of Trump's tariffs.
    * *Risk:* Uncertainty or a ruling that forces alternative revenue avenues could rattle markets.

4.  **Geopolitics (Iran Revolution):**
    * **Event:** Protests in Iran; 50% inflation; Regime change possible.
    * **Policy:** Trump threatens **25% Tariff** on any nation doing business with Iran.

### 5. Scenarios & Invalidations
* **Bear Trigger (Confirmation):**
    * **Technical:** `$SPX` breaks the lower trendline of the Rising Wedge.
    * **Macro:** A "Hot" CPI print or adverse Supreme Court ruling spikes `$US10Y` (confirming Inv. H&S).
    * **Crypto:** `$BTC` breaks April lows.
* **Bull Trigger (Invalidation):**
    * **Technical:** `$NDX` closes convincingly above the Oct 29th peak, erasing the inter-market divergence.
    * **Macro:** Inflation data comes in cooler than expected, allowing yields to fade.

---

### 6. Glossary of Financial Jargon
* **Dow Theory:** A trading approach asserting that major market trends must be confirmed by both the Industrial (`$DJI`) and Transport (`$^DJT`) averages moving in the same direction.
* **Hanging Man:** A bearish candlestick pattern formed at the end of an uptrend, characterized by a small body and long lower shadow, indicating sellers are testing buyers.
* **Gap and Trap:** A scenario where price gaps up (or down) at the open, enticing traders to enter, before reversing direction and trapping those positions.
* **Rising Wedge:** A bearish chart pattern formed by converging trendlines where the lows are rising faster than the highs.
