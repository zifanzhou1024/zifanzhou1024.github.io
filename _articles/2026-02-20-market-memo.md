# Investment Research Memo
**Date:** February 20, 2026

### 1. Executive Summary

* **Market Bias:** Bearish
* **The Core Thesis:** The broader market is masking severe underlying weakness, characterized by sweeping technical divergences across major indices and a catastrophic miss in Q4 GDP data (1.4% actual vs. 2.5% expected). Current sideways price action is designed to create maximum complacency right before key fundamental, corporate, and geopolitical catalysts hit.
* **Key Risk/Warning:** The combination of `$NVDA` earnings and an impending U.S. military strike on Iran (expected in early March) could force crude oil higher and trigger margin calls across risk assets. This would likely cause a cascading, algorithmic market sell-off, heavily impacting collateral assets like `$BTC`.

### 2. The 'Alpha' Logic (The Speaker's Unique Angle)

The primary analytical framework driving this thesis is **Multi-Timeframe Indicator Divergence paired with Historical Fractals**.
The speaker is tracking significant bearish divergences on momentum oscillators (MACD, RSI, Awesome Oscillator) against price action making marginal new highs. This is cross-referenced with historical analogs—specifically, comparing the current 1-day divergence between the `$DJI` and `^DJT` to the 6-day divergence preceding the 1987 crash, and equating the current `$DXY` bottoming structure to the 2022 setup that triggered a massive equity sell-off. Furthermore, the VIX is flashing major warning signs, hovering above both its 50-day and 200-day moving averages while its MACD sits in positive territory.

### 3. Recommended Market Moves

* **Short-Term (1 Day): Neutral / Wait-and-See**
  The market just experienced a temporary relief rally following the Supreme Court tariff ruling, with `$NDX` up 215 points and `$SPX` up 47.5 points, while the VIX pulled back 5.64%. However, these indices are rallying directly into major moving average resistance in the daily timeframe. Avoid chasing this immediate upside; wait to see if prices face firm rejection at these moving averages or confirm a breakout.
* **Mid-Term (1 Week): Prepare for High Volatility & Downside Triggers**
  This week is loaded with massive catalysts: the State of the Union on Tuesday, `$NVDA` earnings on Wednesday, and the PPI inflation report on Friday. If `$NVDA` earnings fail to impress, it could trigger the completion of its Head & Shoulders pattern. Position defensively, look for potential short entries if `$SPX` and `$NDX` daily/weekly signals remain bearish, and watch the November lows on the `$SPX` as the critical support line.
* **Long-Term (1 Month): Heavily Bearish Bias**
  With the administration ready to launch a multi-week military campaign in the Middle East in the next 10 to 15 days, combined with severely deteriorating macro growth (1.4% GDP) and sticky inflation, the structural trend leans downward. Consider building short positions on major indices aiming for the 200-week moving averages or April lows. Simultaneously, prepare for a surging `$DXY` as a safe haven and watch out for forced liquidations in `$BTC` due to widespread margin calls.

### 4. Technical Analysis & Trade Setups

* **`$DXY` (US Dollar Index):**
    * **Price Levels:** Target is the upper boundary of the weekly channel.
    * **The Setup:** Forming a large weekly Bull Flag

    * [Image of Bull Flag chart pattern]
    with a massive bullish divergence. Stochastics are turning up. The narrative that the dollar will collapse is likely wrong.
* **Verdict:** Long. Expect a sharp surge similar to 2022.
* **`$US10Y` (10-Year Treasury Yield):**
    * **Price Levels:** Bouncing off the lower boundary, establishing a higher low.
    * **The Setup:** Coiling inside a massive Symmetrical Triangle

    * [Image of Symmetrical Triangle chart pattern]
    . Yields avoided an immediate spike because the Supreme Court remained silent on refunding billions in collected tariff capital, locking it in the courts for years.
* **Verdict:** Wait for the breakout, but structurally biased for a surge.
* **`$SPX` (S&P 500):**
    * **Price Levels:** Closed up 47.5 points (0.69%) to just above 6,900. Upside target (if signals flip) is the January 28th peak/upper channel boundary. Downside support is the early February and December lows, ultimately targeting the November low.
    * **The Setup:** Flashing a bearish reversal of conditions on both daily and weekly timeframes, with the VIX MACD above zero. Carving out an Adam and Eve Double Top

    * [Image of Double Top chart pattern]
and a potential Head and Shoulders pattern. Sideways action is mimicking `$BTC` right before its major drop.
* **Verdict:** Short-biased. Wait for confirmation below the November low.
* **`$NDX` (NASDAQ 100):**
    * **Price Levels:** Rallied 215 points (0.87%) on the day, but moving averages (10, 20, 50-day) are now acting as heavy overhead resistance.
    * **The Setup:** Bearish moving average alignment (10 below 20; 20 and 10 below 50). Three consecutive weeks of bearish reversal conditions (red bars, red cloud).
    * **Verdict:** Short.
* **`$NVDA` (Nvidia):**
    * **Price Levels:** Closed up 1.02% on Friday. Downside target is the 200-day moving average and April low. Upside features an unfilled gap "way up here."
    * **The Setup:** Printing a Broadening Formation evolving into a Head and Shoulders pattern

    * [Image of Head and Shoulders chart pattern]
on the weekly chart.
* **Verdict:** Wait for earnings catalyst (Wednesday).
* **`$DJI` (Dow Jones Industrial Average):**
    * **Price Levels:** Up 230 points (almost 0.5%) but hovering just below the 50,000 psychological level. Downside targets are the 200-week moving average and the April low.
    * **The Setup:** Grinding inside a massive Rising Wedge

    * [Image of Rising Wedge chart pattern]
with extreme, multi-point bearish divergences across MACD, RSI, Stochastic, and Money Flow. 50,000 is viewed as a bull trap / sell signal to distract from the tech selloff.
* **Verdict:** Short.
* **`$IWM` (Russell 2000):**
    * **Price Levels:** Closed down 0.05% (essentially flat) during the broader market relief rally.
    * **Verdict:** Neutral/Weak.

### 5. Macro & Fundamental Drivers

* **Tariff Policy Pivot:** While the Supreme Court struck down Trump's IEEPA-based tariffs, the administration is bypassing this by signing an executive order for a new 10% global tax under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed at the Dallas Economic Club that they are leveraging existing laws, resulting in "virtually unchanged tariff revenue for 2026."
* **Macro Data Contraction (Stagflation Warning):**
    * **Q4 GDP:** Printed at a catastrophic 1.4%, drastically lower than the 2.8% consensus and the previous quarter's 4.4%. The Fed originally estimated Q4 at 5.4-5.5% in January, hastily revising it to 3% right before the print. The annualized rate is now just 2.2%.
    * **Inflation:** Core PCE came in hotter than expected at 0.4% MoM. Year-over-year PCE hit 2.9% (vs 2.8% expected), and Core YoY hit 3%. With wholesale inflation (PPI) already jumping in recent reports, Friday's upcoming PPI data is critical.
* **Geopolitical / Event Catalysts:**
    * **State of the Union:** Tuesday.
    * **`$NVDA` Earnings:** Wednesday (Feb 25th) after the bell.
    * **Middle East Escalation:** The Vice President stated Iran is not agreeing to U.S. demands. The President has signaled a decision on a major, multi-week military strike against Iran within the next 10-15 days (early March or sooner). This is already driving crude oil higher.

### 6. Scenarios & Invalidations

* **Bull Trigger:** If `$SPX` and `$NDX` can completely flip daily and weekly signals back to bullish, driving a confirmed close above the January highs and invalidating the oscillators' bearish divergences, the thesis is wrong and a push to the upper channel boundaries begins.
* **Bear Trigger:** If `$NVDA` earnings disappoint, causing `$NVDA` to break its Head and Shoulders neckline, and `$SPX` subsequently loses the November lows. This confirms the Adam & Eve top and triggers algorithmic distribution.

---

### 7. Glossary of Financial Jargon

* **Adam and Eve Double Top:** A bearish reversal chart pattern featuring two peaks: a sharp, pointed first peak (Adam) followed by a wider, rounded second peak (Eve).
* **Bull Flag:** A bullish continuation pattern where price consolidates in a downward channel following a sharp upward move, resembling a flag on a pole.
* **Head and Shoulders:** A highly reliable technical pattern featuring three peaks (the middle being the highest), signaling a shift from a bullish to a bearish trend once the "neckline" support is broken.
* **Rising Wedge:** A bearish pattern characterized by converging upward-sloping support and resistance lines, typically resolving in a breakdown.
* **Divergence:** When the price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of a technical indicator (like the MACD or RSI), warning that the current price trend is weakening and may reverse.
* **VIX (Volatility Index):** Often called the "fear gauge," it measures the stock market's expectation of volatility based on S&P 500 index options. A rising VIX above key moving averages signals expected market turbulence.
* **Margin Call:** A demand by a broker that an investor deposit further cash or securities to cover possible losses. In a falling market, margin calls force investors to sell liquid assets (like `$BTC` or equities) to raise cash, accelerating the sell-off.

### 8. Consolidated Watchlist Table

| Ticker  | Bias    | Key Level to Watch        | Notes                                                                                            |
|:--------|:--------|:--------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$DXY`  | Bull    | Upper channel boundary    | Flashing a massive weekly Bull Flag and bullish divergence.                                      |
| `$SPX`  | Bear    | November lows             | Complacency chop. Watch for a break below the neckline to confirm the Adam & Eve top.            |
| `$NDX`  | Bear    | 50-day MA                 | Acting as heavy overhead resistance; bearish alignment across short-term MAs.                    |
| `$NVDA` | Neutral | Head & Shoulders Neckline | Earnings Wednesday. A break below the neckline triggers the broader AI/Tech selloff.             |
| `$DJI`  | Bear    | 50,000                    | The 50k level is a major bull trap/distraction hiding severe multi-indicator divergences.        |
| `^DJT`  | Bear    | N/A                       | Only a 1-day divergence from the `$DJI` currently; a widening gap is a classic pre-crash signal. |
| `$BTC`  | Bear    | N/A                       | Highly vulnerable to forced liquidations and collateral damage if a margin-call event begins.    |
