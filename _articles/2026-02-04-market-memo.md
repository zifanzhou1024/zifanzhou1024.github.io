# Investment Research Memo

**Date:** February 4, 2026 (Implied based on AMD drop & Amazon earnings context)
**Subject:** Market Reversal & AI Bubble Burst
**Analyst:** Gemini Senior Equities Desk

---

### 1. Executive Summary
* **Market Bias:** **Strongly Bearish**
* **The Core Thesis:** The "AI Bubble" has begun to burst, catalyzed by a massive earnings miss from `$AMD` (-17%) and structural breakdowns in `$NVDA` and `$NDX`. This tech rotation is exacerbated by severe deterioration in the labor market (ADP Miss), signaling a recessionary onset similar to 2007 and 2000.
* **Key Risk/Warning:** The primary downside catalyst is a "Crash Wave 3" in the semiconductor sector; however, the `$VIX` indicates an 85% probability of a short-term bounce/up-day tomorrow before the selling resumes.

---

### 2. The 'Alpha' Logic (The Speaker's Unique Angle)
* **The "Crypto Lead-Lag" Indicator:** The analysis relies heavily on `$BTC` (Bitcoin) acting as a leading indicator for the broader equity market. `$BTC` has already broken key support (lost 80k, then 74k, down 43% total), establishing a bearish precedent. The thesis posits that `$NDX` (Nasdaq) and `$SPY` (S&P 500) are structurally tethered to this liquidity move and will now "play catch up" to the downside.
* **The "2022 Fractal":** The speaker identifies a specific divergence pattern mirroring the 2022 market top: `$SPY` making a marginal new high (bull trap) while `$NDX` makes a lower high, confirmed by RSI/MACD divergences.

### 3. Technical Analysis & Trade Setups

#### **`$NVDA` (Nvidia)**
* **Price Levels:**
    * **Current Action:** Down ~9% on the week; broke below **10, 20, and 50-day MAs**.
    * **Key Support:** The Head and Shoulders "Neckline" (Critical).
    * **Targets:** **50-Week MA** $\rightarrow$ **200-Week MA** (Long term).
* **The Setup:** A **"Head and Shoulders"** top is forming on the weekly timeframe. This is combined with a confirmed negative divergence on **MACD**, **RSI**, and **Stochastic** (which has rolled over). The stock printed a "Doji" candlestick followed by 3 days of selling.
* `[Chart Pattern: Head and Shoulders Top]`
* **Verdict:** **Short** on confirmation of neckline breach.

#### **`$NDX` / `$QQQ` (Nasdaq 100)**
* **Price Levels:**
    * **Resistance:** October High / January High (Black candlestick printed above Upper Bollinger Band).
    * **Support:** November Lows (Confirmation Line); Breached January & December lows.
    * **Target:** April Lows.
* **The Setup:** **"Adam and Eve" Double Top** pattern. The "Adam" peak is the sharp first high, and the "Eve" is the rounding second peak (lower high). The index has broken the trendline connecting the Nov low to the Jan low.
    * *Indicators:* **MACD** rolled over to negative; closed below the **100-day MA** and the lower Bollinger Band.
* `[Chart Pattern: Adam and Eve Double Top]`
* **Verdict:** **Short**. The index is entering "Crash Wave 3."

#### **`$SPY` (S&P 500)**
* **Price Levels:**
    * **Target:** 5,300 (78.6% Fibonacci retracement) or April Lows.
    * **Resistance:** 2021 Peak levels (failed breakout).
    * **Current Status:** Holding just above the **50-day MA**.
* **The Setup:** Bearish Reversal of Conditions. `$SPY` printed a "Shooting Star" / "Topping Tail" candle. While `$SPY` made a higher high recently, it failed to hold, creating a massive divergence against `$NDX`.
    * *Indicators:* **Awesome Oscillator** printed red bars; **MACD** rolled over yesterday.
* `[Chart Pattern: Shooting Star Candlestick]`
* **Verdict:** **Bearish**. Expect a drop over the next 6-12 weeks.

#### **`$SMH` (Semiconductor ETF)**
* **The Setup:** **Rising Wedge** breakdown confirmed by `$AMD`'s 17% collapse. Divergences are playing out fully.
* `[Chart Pattern: Rising Wedge Breakdown]`
* **Verdict:** **Avoid/Short**.

### 4. Macro & Fundamental Drivers
* **Labor Market Deterioration:**
    * **ADP Private Payrolls:** Reported **22,000** vs. Estimated **45,000**. (Previous month: 37k).
    * **Implication:** The labor market is collapsing faster than consensus expects, a hallmark signal preceding the 2007 and 2000 recessions.
* **Corporate Earnings:**
    * **`$AMD`:** Down 17% (Worst day since 2017) – The primary drag on the sector.
    * **`$GOOGL` (Alphabet):** Beat earnings but stock down ~2% (Sell the news).
    * **`$AMZN` (Amazon):** Earnings pending (After close tomorrow).
* **Policy & Geopolitics:**
    * **Tariffs:** Supreme Court ruling on Trump's tariffs expected in February (potential market mover).
    * **Middle East:** Potential US strike on Iran cited as a volatility catalyst; markets currently ignoring it but could be a "black swan."
    * **Federal Reserve:** "Panic" rate cuts expected later (Jumbo cuts), but only *after* the crash initiates.

### 5. Recommended Moves (Time Horizon)

#### **Short Term (1 Day)**
* **Action:** **Tactical Long / Cover Shorts.**
* **Rationale:** The `$VIX` closed at 18.64 (up 3.5%). The speaker notes an **85% statistical probability of an "up day"** tomorrow based on yesterday's `$SPY` price action and VIX behavior.
* **Key Watch:** Watch for a bounce to back-test broken trendlines on `$NDX`.

#### **Mid Term (1 Week)**
* **Action:** **Sell into Strength / Re-enter Shorts.**
* **Rationale:** Any bounce is likely a "dead cat bounce" or a back-test of resistance (e.g., the broken Nov-Jan trendline on Nasdaq).
* **Key Watch:** Watch for the weekly close on Friday. A close below the **10-week** and **20-week MAs** on `$NDX` confirms the bearish reversal of conditions.

#### **Long Term (1 Month)**
* **Action:** **Aggressive Short / Portfolio Protection.**
* **Rationale:** We are entering "Crash Wave 3." The target is a 20%+ correction over the next 6-12 weeks.
* **Key Watch:** The breach of the **November Lows** (Confirmation Line) on `$NDX` and `$SPY`. Target a move to the **April Lows** and eventually the **200-Week Moving Average**.

---

### 6. Scenarios & Invalidations
* **Bull Trigger:** A "Fed Panic" leading to "Jumbo Rate Cuts." This is viewed as the catalyst for the *next* bull run, but only *after* the crash plays out.
* **Bear Trigger:** A confirmed daily close below the **November Lows** on `$NDX`. This confirms the Double Top and accelerates the move to the April lows.

---

### 7. Glossary of Financial Jargon
* **Adam and Eve Double Top:** A chart pattern characterized by a sharp, spike-like first peak ("Adam") followed by a gentler, rounded second peak ("Eve"), signaling a potential bearish reversal.
* **Doji Candlestick:** A trading session where the open and close prices are virtually equal, representing indecision in the market. Often signals a reversal when found at a top.
* **Confirmation Line:** A specific support level (usually the trough between two peaks) that, if broken, confirms the validity of a chart pattern (like a Double Top).
* **Rising Wedge:** A bearish chart pattern formed by converging trend lines that slant upward. A break below the lower trend line indicates a price drop.
* **Bollinger Bands:** A volatility indicator. A black candle closing *above* the upper band followed by a reversal is often interpreted as an exhaustion signal (overbought).
