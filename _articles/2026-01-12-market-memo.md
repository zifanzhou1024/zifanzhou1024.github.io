# Investment Research Memo

**To:** Portfolio Management Team
**From:** Senior Desk Analyst
**Date:** January 12, 2026
**Subject:** FED CRIMINAL PROBE, IRAN REVOLUTION & DOW THEORY DIVERGENCES

---

### 1. Executive Summary
* **Market Bias:** **BEARISH / HIGH ALERT**
* **The Core Thesis:** The market is facing a "Triple Threat" of catalysts this week (CPI, PPI, Supreme Court Tariff Ruling) while displaying classic late-cycle technical divergences. The analyst believes equities are "lagging" the Bitcoin bear market and will soon "catch up" to the downside, triggered by a potential spike in yields and a banking crisis stemming from Commercial Real Estate (CRE).
* **Key Risk:** **Systemic "Crack" in Bonds.** The analyst cites "Jamie Dimon's crack in the bond market" as the mechanism that will break CRE refinancing and spill over into a broader Banking Crisis.

---

### 2. The 'Alpha' Logic (The Analyst's Edge)
* **The "Catch-Up" Trade:** The analyst views `$BTC` (Bitcoin) as the leading liquidity indicator. Bitcoin has already confirmed a bear market and "second leg lower." The thesis is that `$SPX` and `$NDX` are living on borrowed time and must mechanically re-price lower to match crypto's liquidity contraction.
* **Historical Lag Analysis (Dow Theory):**
    * The analyst refutes the bullish "confirmation" of `$DJTA` making new highs.
    * **The "Death Zone" Lag:** Historical crashes occur shortly after `$DJI` and `$DJTA` diverge.
    * **1987 Crash:** 7-day lag.
    * **2018 Selloff:** 8-day lag.
    * **1973 Crash:** 23-day lag.
    * **Current Status:** We have a **1-day divergence** (Dow new high, Transports did not). This small window is historically sufficient to precede a crash.

---

### 3. Macro & Fundamental Catalyst Watch
* **Fed Governance Crisis (New Development):**
    * **Event:** Chair Powell is reportedly under **criminal investigation** by the DOJ for potentially lying to Congress regarding the Federal Reserve building renovation.
    * **The Numbers:** Project cost ballooned from **\$1.9 Billion** (original) to **\$2.5–\$3.0 Billion**. Over budget by at least $600M.
    * **Market Impact:** While markets initially shrugged it off, attacks on Fed independence create structural uncertainty. Powell exits in May regardless.
* **Inflation & Data:**
    * **CPI (Tue Jan 13, Pre-market):** Expected Headline 2.7%; Core 2.8%. *Risk:* A hot print spikes yields immediately.
    * **PPI (Wed Jan 14, Pre-market):** Wholesale inflation data.
* **The "Tariff Decision" (Wed Jan 14):**
    * **Event:** Potential Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of Trump's tariffs.
    * **Risk:** An "Unconstitutional" ruling creates fiscal uncertainty/chaos; a confirmation cements trade war fears.
* **Geopolitics (Iran Revolution):**
    * **Situation:** Iranian populace rising up; facing **50% inflation**. Regime change possible.
    * **US Policy:** Trump threat: Any country doing business with Iran faces a **25% Tariff**.
    * **Impact:** Potential volatility in Energy and safe havens.

### 4. Technical Analysis & Specific Setups

#### `$SPX` (S&P 500) & `$NDX` (Nasdaq 100)
* **Pattern:** **Rising Wedge** on Daily & 60-min charts.
* **Divergence:** "Multiple Point Divergences" on RSI, MACD, and Price Oscillator.
* **Inter-Market Divergence:** `$SPX` made a higher high; `$NDX` remains below its Oct 29th peak (reminiscent of the 2022 top).
* **Intraday Action:** Market gapped down overnight, filled the gap ("Gap and Trap"), and closed green, but structural weakness remains.
* **Verdict:** **Short** on breakdown of wedge support.

#### `$NVDA` (Nvidia)
* **Price Action:** Struggling at the **10-day SMA**.
* **Structure:** Potential **Head and Shoulders** on the Weekly timeframe.
* **Downside Target:** If it breaks the 50-day SMA/Neckline, the target is the **200-week moving average**.
* **Verdict:** **High Alert** for distribution.

#### `$US10Y` (10-Year Yield)
* **Pattern:** **Inverse Head and Shoulders**.
* **Implication:** Yields are projected to break out to new highs.
* **Correlation:** Rising yields are the "kryptonite" for the current equity valuation (negative correlation).
* **Verdict:** **Bullish Yields (Bearish Bonds)**.

#### `$VIX` (Volatility Index)
* **The Anomaly:** `$VIX` was **UP 4.35%** on a day when the S&P 500 closed POSITIVE.
* **Signal:** This is a classic "volatility divergence," indicating sophisticated players are buying protection (puts) despite the green price action.

#### Financials (`$XLF` / Banks)
* **Headwind:** Trump announced a **10% Interest Rate Cap** on credit cards.
* **Reaction:** `$AXP`, `$COF`, and issuers sold off sharply.
* **Systemic Risk:** Rising yields + Commercial Real Estate (CRE) defaults = Potential Banking Crisis.

| `$VIX`   | Bull | **Signal:** Green Close                      | `$VIX` green on a green market day = danger.           |
| `$DJTA`  | Neut | **Signal:** Divergence                       | Did not confirm Dow's new high on the specific day.    |

### 6. Actionable Trade Idea
**Strategy:** **Bearish Put Spread on `$NDX` (Nasdaq)**
* **Rationale:** The Nasdaq is the "laggard" (has not made a new high) and is most sensitive to the projected spike in Yields (`$US10Y`).
* **Trigger:** Entry upon a close below the **20-day Moving Average** or a "Hot" CPI print.
* **Target:** Gap fill from previous weeks.
