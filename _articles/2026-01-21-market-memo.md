# Investment Research Memo

**TO:** Investment Committee
**FROM:** Equities & Macro Desk
**SUBJECT:** Technical Exhaustion, VIX Probabilities & Yield Breakouts (`$SPX`, `$NDX`, `$US10Y`)
**DATE:** January 21, 2026

---

### 1. Executive Summary

* **Market Bias:** **Bearish** (Fade the rally).
* **The Core Thesis:** The recent market rebound is a "dead cat bounce" driven by 3 specific headlines regarding a Trump/Greenland deal, masking severe technical deterioration. With `$SPX` slamming into a "100-year channel" resistance and `$US10Y` yields breaking out of a multi-year triangle, the desk views this as a major top similar to 2022.
* **Key Risk/Warning:** **VIX Probability Signal.** The `$VIX` is explicitly predicting an **85% probability** of a downside reversal or "red day" within the next two trading sessions.

---

### 2. The 'Alpha' Logic (The Speaker's Unique Angle)

* **VIX Mean Reversion Probability:** The speaker utilizes a specific historical probability model based on `$VIX` movement.
    * **The Setup:** Yesterday, the `$VIX` spiked >20% (predicting a 95% chance of a relief rally, which occurred).
    * **The Current Signal:** Today, the `$VIX` dropped <10%. Historically, this predicts an **85% chance** that the market will reverse and have a down day within the next 2 sessions (Thursday or Friday).
* **The "2022 Fractal" & Lead-Lag Sequence:** The analysis identifies a recurring topping sequence:
    1.  `$BTC` peaks first (Jan 14th).
    2.  `$NDX` rolls over next.
    3.  `$SPX` makes a final diverging high (Jan 12th) before collapsing.
    * *Current Status:* `$NDX` is showing relative weakness and has already confirmed a lower high, validating this sequence.

### 3. Technical Analysis & Trade Setups

#### **S&P 500 (`$SPX`)**
* **Price Levels:**
    * **Resistance:** The "Gap Fill" zone (failed to reach today), 10 & 20-day Moving Averages (MAs), and the **100-Year Channel Line**.
    * **Support:** **November Lows** (Critical Bear Trigger), April Low Trendline.
    * **Target:** A drop to the 200-day MA or horizontal support at the April lows.
* **The Setup:** **Wyckoff Distribution & Rising Wedge Breakdown.**
    * The index broke the lower boundary of a Rising Wedge.
    * The current rally is viewed as a "back-test" of that breakdown.
    * The structure resembles a **Wyckoff Distribution** phase (series of lower highs).
    * Momentum (MACD, Cloud) has flipped bearish.

* **Verdict:** **Short** (Fade rallies into the 10/20-day MA).

#### **Nasdaq 100 (`$NDX`)**
* **Price Levels:**
    * **Resistance:** Intraday Gap Fill (touched and rejected), 20-day MA.
    * **Support:** 100-day MA.
* **The Setup:** **Bearish Divergence.**
    * Unlike `$SPX`, `$NDX` managed to fill its gap intraday but failed to close there ("Close but no cigar").
    * The **Awesome Oscillator** and **MACD** have flipped negative/bearish.
    * The formation is a clear "lower high" relative to `$SPX`.
* **Verdict:** **Short** (High conviction due to relative weakness).

#### **US Treasury Yields (`$US10Y` / `$US30Y`)**
* **Price Levels:**
    * **Target:** **>5.00%** on the 10-Year.
* **The Setup:** **Inverse Head and Shoulders Breakout.**
    * Both `$US10Y` and `$US30Y` have broke out of massive multi-year consolidation triangles.
    * The recent pullback is a technical retest of the breakout level (the "neckline") before the next leg higher.

* **Verdict:** **Long Yields / Short Bonds** (`$TLT`).

#### **Volatility Index (`$VIX`)**
* **The Setup:** **200-MA Rejection & Gap Fill.**
    * The `$VIX` gapped up above the 200-period MA, formed a "Doji" (indecision candle), and pulled back to fill its own gap.
    * **Bullish Case for Volatility:** If `$VIX` holds the gap fill and reclaims the 50-period MA, the equity selloff accelerates.
* **Verdict:** **Long Volatility.**

### 4. Macro & Fundamental Drivers

* **The "Greenland Triad" Catalyst:** The speaker attributes the specific relief rally to three Trump-related headlines that calmed markets temporarily:
    1.  Trump stating he would **not** use military force to take Greenland.
    2.  Trump **calling off tariffs** on 8 European countries.
    3.  Trump announcing a "framework" for a Greenland deal with NATO.
* **Yield Shock:** A breakout in yields (`$US10Y` > 5%) is viewed as the primary macro catalyst that will "rattle" the stock market, potentially triggering a banking crisis liquidity event.
* **Fed Policy:** The desk anticipates the Federal Reserve will eventually panic and pivot, but **only after** a ~20% market correction occurs in Q1.

---

### 5. Scenarios & Invalidations

* **Bear Trigger (Confirmation):**
    * **Loss of November Lows:** This is the critical line in the sand. Losing this level confirms the Double Top and Wyckoff distribution, opening the door for a crash.
    * **MA Crossover:** If the 10-day MA crosses below the 20-day MA, it confirms the bearish trend change.
* **Bull Trigger (Invalidation):**
    * **Momentum Flip:** If the Daily Cloud and MACD flip back to Green/Bullish.
    * **Gap Reclamation:** If `$SPX` fills the overhead gap *and* successfully closes above the 20-day MA, the Rising Wedge breakdown is invalidated.

### 6. Glossary of Financial Jargon

* **Wyckoff Distribution:** A market phase where "smart money" institutional investors systematically sell positions to retail investors near a market top through a series of "lower highs" before a markdown begins.
* **Gap Fill:** A price movement where an asset trades back to the price level of a previous day's close, "filling" an empty space on the chart caused by a pre-market jump or drop.
* **Divergence:** When the price of an asset moves in the opposite direction of a technical indicator (e.g., Price makes a higher high, but MACD makes a lower high), usually signaling a reversal.
* **Doji:** A candlestick pattern that looks like a cross (Open = Close), indicating indecision between buyers and sellers; often precedes a reversal.
