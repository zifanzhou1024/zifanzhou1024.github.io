# INTERNAL MEMO: GLOBAL MACRO & RISK DESK

**TO:** Investment Committee & Proprietary Trading Desk
**FROM:** Senior Portfolio Manager
**DATE:** January 20, 2026
**SUBJECT:** HIGH CONVICTION SHORT SETUP - CONFLUENCE OF YIELDS, CRYPTO FRACTALS, & MACRO RISKS

---

### 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & URGENCY
* **Market Bias:** **Aggressively Bearish**. The "Soft Landing" narrative is formally rejected.
* **The Thesis:** We are witnessing a repeat of the 2007/2008 and 2021/2022 topping processes. The catalyst sequence is: Sticky Inflation (PPI 3%) → Fed Panic (delayed "Jumbo Cuts" to chase recession) → Yield Curve Steepening → Equity Capitulation.
* **Immediate Trigger:** The **10-Year Yield (`$TNX`)** has broken out to new highs, coincident with **Bitcoin (`$BTC`)** rejecting off critical resistance (Bear Flag). As seen in 2022, Crypto is the leading liquidity gauge; its breakdown signals `$SPX` is next.

### 2. THE "ALPHA" LOGIC: FRACTALS & LEAD-LAG RELATIONSHIPS

#### **A. The Bitcoin Lead-Lag Fractal (2021 vs. Today)**
* **Mechanism:** In 2021/22, `$BTC` peaked and dropped 36%, then staged a "miniature relief rally" into a Bear Flag before a 50% collapse. `$SPX` / `$NDX` ignored the initial drop, went sideways/diverged, and then "played catch-up" violently.
* **Current Signal:** `$BTC` has replicated this exact sequence: The initial drop, the counter-trend relief rally, and is now triggering **momentum sell signals** at the 100-period MA and 38.2% Fibonacci.
* **Implication:** If `$BTC` fulfills its measured move (target: $61k), `$SPX` will exit its "denial phase" and crash >20% to the 200-Week MA.

#### **B. The Yield Curve "Trap"**
* **The Signal:** The 10Y-2Y yield curve has **un-inverted** and is now **steepening**.
* **Historical Context:** In 2000 and 2007, the market topped *after* the curve un-inverted and began steepening. The "steepener" is the recession confirmation, not the all-clear signal.

### 3. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS & TRADE SETUPS

#### **Bitcoin (`$BTC`) - The Canary in the Coal Mine**
* **Pattern:** **Bear Flag** on the daily timeframe.
* **Key Resistance Cluster:**
    * 100-Period Moving Average.
    * 38.2% Fibonacci Retracement.
    * Upper Trendline of the Bear Flag.
* **The Setup:** Momentum signals have flipped bearish. A breakdown below the flag support triggers a **Measured Move** down to **~$61,000** (approx. 50% decline, consistent with historical bear market kick-offs).
* **Action:** Short on confirmation of flag breakdown.

#### **US Treasury Yields (`$TNX` & `$USB`) - The Wrecking Ball**
* **10-Year Index (`$TNX`):**
    * **Status:** **Breakout** confirmed. Price has cleared the neckline of a massive **Inverse Head & Shoulders** pattern and gapped higher.
    * **Wave Count:** Likely entering Wave 5 of a multi-year triangle breakout.
* **30-Year Bonds:**
    * **Status:** Bouncing off the 50-period MA; forming back-to-back **Bull Flags** (bearish for bond prices).
    * **Technicals:** The 50-period MA is about to cross back above the 200-period MA (Golden Cross for yields).

#### **Equities (`$SPX` / `$NDX`)**
* **Divergence:** `$NDX` is making lower highs while `$SPX` grinds to marginal new highs—a classic exhaustion signal seen in late 2021.
* **Target:** The **200-Week Moving Average** (historical bear market floor).
* **Note:** Markets are closed Monday (MLK Day), creating potential for a "gap down" open on Tuesday if geopolitical news breaks over the weekend.

### 4. MACRO & FUNDAMENTAL CATALYSTS

#### **A. Fed Chair & Policy Uncertainty**
* **The "Hassett vs. Warsh" Pivot:** Markets priced in Kevin Hassett (Ultra-Dove/Trump Advisor) as the next Fed Chair.
* **The Shift:** Trump signaled keeping Hassett in his current role. Betting markets have shifted to **Kevin Warsh** (Former Fed Governor).
* **Market Impact:** Warsh is perceived as less dovish than Hassett. This repricing is forcing yields higher, as the "aggressive cut" premium is removed.

#### **B. Banking Sector "Doom Loop" Risks**
* **Trump's Credit Cap:** Proposed **10% cap on credit card interest rates**. If enacted, this decimates bank profitability.
* **Commercial Real Estate (CRE):** A wall of refinancing is hitting while long-term yields are breaking out.
* **Result:** Banks face a dual threat of realized losses on CRE portfolios + revenue caps. A banking crisis similar to 2008 is a high-probability tail risk.

#### **C. Supreme Court "Wildcard" (Tariffs)**
* **The Event:** Pending SCOTUS ruling on the constitutionality of Presidential tariffs (IEEPA authority).
* **The Risk:** If the court rules tariffs unconstitutional, markets may panic, but paradoxically, the analyst suggests this could trigger further volatility in yields (uncertainty premium).

#### **D. Geopolitics**
* **Iran:** Potential for US strikes/retaliation following protests. Trump warned regime against killing protesters.
* **Greenland/US:** Mentioned as a peripheral geopolitical friction point.
* **Timing:** Military action often occurs over long weekends (MLK Day), adding gap risk to Tuesday's open.

### 5. VALUATION EXTREMES
* **The Buffett Indicator:** Market Cap to GDP is at **222%** (New ATH).
    * *Context:* Tech Bubble peak was ~150%. This is the "Mother of All Bubbles."
* **Shiller PE:** At extremes historically associated with negative 10-year forward returns.

### 6. CONSOLIDATED WATCHLIST

| Ticker     | Position Bias   | Critical Level           | Notes                                                                                 |
|:-----------|:----------------|:-------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **`$BTC`** | **HARD SHORT**  | **<$90k (Flag Support)** | Targeting $61k. If this breaks, Short `$SPX` immediately.                             |
| **`$TNX`** | **LONG YIELDS** | **> 4.5% / 5.0%**        | Breakout of Inverse H&S is active. Yields >5% breaks the banks.                       |
| **`$SPX`** | **SHORT**       | **200-Week MA**          | The "Line in the Sand." We are currently forming the "Right Shoulder" of a macro top. |
| **`$XLF`** | **SHORT**       | **N/A**                  | Financials are the weak link due to CRE exposure + 10% Rate Cap risk.                 |

**Analyst Note:** Do not get baited by the "Soft Landing" narrative. The Fed is reacting, not leading. When they panic and start "Jumbo Cuts" (likely later this year), the market will already be 20% lower.
