# Investment Research Memo
**Date:** February 12, 2026

### 1. Executive Summary
* **Market Bias:** **Bearish**
* **Market Context:** The market is currently exhibiting mixed, choppy price action. At the time of the recording, the `$DJI` was up 49 points (+0.10%), the `$SPY` was functionally flat (-0.05%), the `$NDX` was down 50 points (-0.25%), and the `$RUT` was up 1.18%. The VIX closed down 1% but remains elevated at 20.60.
* **The Core Thesis:** The broader equities market is currently in a deceptive "Stage 3" distribution phase, masking heavy institutional selling in the tech sector behind the headline-grabbing `$DJI` 50,000 milestone. We are seeing a structural repeat of 2000, 2007, and 2022, where highly correlated risk-on assets (`$BTC`, `$MSTR`, Magnificent 7) top and collapse first, eventually dragging down the broader indices.
* **Key Risk/Warning:** The immediate danger is a dual-shock catalyst: a potential Supreme Court ruling on February 20th against the Trump administration's tariffs (which could trigger a massive spike in the `$US10Y` yield and ignite a banking crisis), combined with a geopolitical strike on Iran this weekend that could severely spike crude oil prices.

### 2. The 'Alpha' Logic (The Speaker's Unique Angle)
* **Lead-Lag Asset Correlation & Institutional Distribution:** The primary analytical framework relies on historical fractals and a lead-lag relationship between ultra-risk assets and broader indices. `$BTC` and `$MSTR` serve as the "canary in the coal mine." `$BTC` has already suffered a 52% drawdown from its October 6th high (dropping initially, rebounding to finish a counter-trend by January 14th, and then dropping another 39% over three weeks). This mirrors its 2022 price action where it dropped first, the market went sideways, and then equities violently caught down.
* **Wyckoff Distribution Divergences:** The speaker heavily relies on Wyckoff Distribution logic to map the top.  The analysis splits the market into two distinct topping structures:
    * **Schematic #1 (Higher High):** Seen in `$BTC` and `$SPY`, where a marginal new high traps late buyers before rejection.
    * **Schematic #2 (Lower High / Double Top):** Seen in the `$NDX`, `$MSTR`, and the Mag 7 ETF, showing exhaustion and failing to reach previous highs while diverging from the `$SPY`.
* **Liquidity vs. QE:** The speaker notes that recent Federal Reserve actions are targeted liquidity injections designed to stave off an underlying banking/commercial real estate crisis, which should not be confused with traditional economic-stimulating Quantitative Easing (QE).

### 3. Technical Analysis & Trade Setups

* **`$NDX` (NASDAQ 100)**
    * **Price Levels:** Target 1: 50-week Moving Average. Target 2: 200-week Moving Average (17,622).
    * **The Setup:** Confirmed reversal bar on the weekly timeframe. Price has closed and remained below the 10-week and 20-week moving averages. Expecting a 2.5-month drawdown similar to the early 2000s tech bubble burst.
    * **Verdict:** Short.

* **`$SPY` (S&P 500)**
    * **Price Levels:** Support: 20-week MA (expected to fail), 200-week MA (macro target). Resistance: January 28th trendline.
    * **The Setup:** Peaked on Jan 28th, slamming into the trendline connecting the Oct and Jan 12th peaks. Printing a bearish reversal of conditions on the weekly chart with negative momentum divergences on RSI, MACD, and Stochastics (breaking below 80).
    * **Verdict:** Short.

* **`$RUT` (Russell 2000)**
    * **The Setup:** Diverging negatively with the S&P 500. It printed a lower high when the S&P made a higher high on January 28th, alongside Class-B MACD and price oscillator divergences.
    * **Verdict:** Wait for weekly reversal confirmation.

* **`$NVDA` (Nvidia) & `$AMD`**
    * **Price Levels (`$NVDA`):** Resistance: October 29th, 2025 high.
    * **The Setup:** `$NVDA` is forming a massive topping structure since October and failing to reclaim highs.

`$AMD` has already triggered a reversal of conditions last week under heavy selling pressure.
* **Verdict:** Short / Wait for `$NVDA` neckline break.

* **Magnificent 7 ETF & `$MSTR` (MicroStrategy)**
    * **The Setup:** Both assets have formed classic distribution patterns, specifically an Adam and Eve Double Top, failing to make new highs.  They are breaking previous lows, confirming the distribution schematic.
    * **Verdict:** Short.

* **`$AAPL` (Apple) & `$GOOGL` (Alphabet)**
    * **The Setup:** `$AAPL` peaked in December 2025 and printed a lower high with a weekly bearish reversal. `$GOOGL` peaked last week and is flashing multiple indicator divergences alongside a weekly bearish reversal.
    * **Verdict:** Short.

* **`$MSFT` (Microsoft) & `$AMZN` (Amazon)**
    * **The Setup:** `$MSFT` formed a double top over the summer and November and has turned down post-earnings. `$AMZN` peaked in November, formed a massive divergence, and triggered a reversal of conditions last week.
    * **Verdict:** Short.

* **`$META` (Meta) & `$TSLA` (Tesla)**
    * **The Setup:** `$META` peaked in August 2025 and narrowly missed a weekly bearish reversal close. `$TSLA` peaked in December and confirmed its bearish reversal three weeks ago.
    * **Verdict:** Short.

### 4. Macro & Fundamental Drivers
* **Inflation Re-acceleration:** CPI headline missed estimates slightly (2.4% vs 2.5% YoY), but the core remained sticky. More importantly, PPI is jumping sharply, suggesting wholesale inflation will soon bleed into CPI, mirroring the 2007-2008 inflation rise.
* **Labor Revisions:** The recent jobs report beat expectations on the headline, but the prior two months were revised downward, and the speaker questions the validity of the annual revisions entirely.
* **GDP Revisions:** Atlanta Fed Q4 2025 GDPNow estimate has been heavily revised down to 3.7% from an initial 5.5%+, pointing to slowing growth despite consensus still lagging at 2.5%.
* **Upcoming Catalysts:**
    * **Feb 16:** Markets closed (President's Day).
    * **Weekend:** High probability of US military action against Iran, posing an upside risk to crude oil (escalation fears regarding the Strait of Hormuz, which handles 25% of global oil).
    * **Feb 20:** Q4 GDP and PCE Inflation Data release (Headline PCE expected to hold at 2.8%, Core expected to tick up to 2.9%).
    * **Feb 20 (Expected):** Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of Trump tariffs. A ruling *against* the administration could force tariff repayments, spiking the `$US10Y` yield and exacerbating unrealized losses in regional bank portfolios (commercial real estate spillover).

### 5. Scenarios & Invalidations
* **Bull Trigger:** If `$SPY` reclaims and breaks cleanly above the diagonal trendline resistance established on January 28th, the Wyckoff distribution thesis is invalidated, indicating a continuation of the primary trend.
* **Bear Trigger:** A weekly close confirming the "Adam and Eve" double top on the Magnificent 7 ETF, combined with `$NDX` breaking its 50-week MA. If the Supreme Court rules against the tariffs on Feb 20th, expect a yield shock to accelerate the equity sell-off.

### 6. Glossary of Financial Jargon
* **Wyckoff Distribution:** A technical analysis framework identifying a market phase where large institutions secretly offload ("distribute") their holdings to retail investors before a major markdown in price. It typically features sideways, choppy price action.
* **Adam and Eve Double Top:** A bearish reversal chart pattern featuring two distinct peaks. The first ("Adam") is a sharp, V-shaped spike. The second ("Eve") is a slower, more rounded peak. It signals exhaustion among buyers.
* **Reversal of Conditions:** A technical signal indicating that the prevailing momentum (bullish or bearish) has exhausted itself and is flipping to the opposite direction, often confirmed on higher timeframes (like the weekly charts used here).
* **Divergence:** When an asset's price makes a new high, but a momentum indicator (like RSI or MACD) makes a lower high. It indicates the trend is losing underlying strength and is prone to a reversal.

### 7. Consolidated Watchlist Table

| Ticker   | Bias | Key Level to Watch | Notes                                                                             |
|:---------|:-----|:-------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `$SPY`   | Bear | 20-week MA         | Breakdown signals the start of the macro correction.                              |
| `$NDX`   | Bear | 17,622             | Ultimate downside target (200-week MA) as tech rotation unwinds.                  |
| `$DJI`   | Bear | 50,000             | Acting as a psychological "distraction" top; expected to follow tech lower.       |
| `$NVDA`  | Bear | Oct 29 High        | Head and shoulders topping structure active; failure to reclaim highs is bearish. |
| `$US10Y` | Bull | New Highs          | A crack in the bond market here threatens regional bank solvency.                 |
| `$BTC`   | Bear | -                  | Primary leading indicator; already front-ran the market dump by 52%.              |

### 8. Recommended Strategic Moves (Timeline-Based)

* **Short-Term (1 Day / Intraday):** * **The Play:** Fade the extremes. Because the broader indices are trapped in a deceptive "Stage 3" Wyckoff distribution, expect violent sideways chop without immediate directional follow-through.
    * **Action:** Rely heavily on intraday flow. Monitor zero-DTE options flow and key Gamma Exposure (GEX) levels on the `$SPX`. Use these gamma walls as strict intraday support/resistance to scalp reversions back to the mean, avoiding breakout trades until a structural level breaks.
* **Mid-Term (1 Week):** * **The Play:** Define your downside risk ahead of binary catalysts. The upcoming week features high-impact, asymmetric risks: a potential weekend geopolitical shock in Iran (spiking oil) and the February 20th Supreme Court tariff decision/PCE data.
    * **Action:** Structure `$QQQ` put spreads. Spreads are highly efficient here—they allow you to capitalize on the confirmed technical weakness in the tech sector (as noted by the breakdown in the Mag 7 and `$NDX`) while capping your premium outlay in case the Supreme Court ruling or PCE data triggers a sudden volatility crush or relief rally.
* **Long-Term (1 Month):** * **The Play:** Position for the macro catch-down. The core thesis dictates that the `$SPY` and `$DJI` will eventually follow `$BTC` and the `$NDX` lower as the weekly MACD and RSI divergences fully play out.
    * **Action:** Begin scaling into longer-dated `$SPX` or `$QQQ` bearish structures. Consider calendar spreads or outright puts targeted at the 50-week and 200-week moving averages, giving the trade 6 to 12 weeks to breathe as the institutional distribution phase transitions into the markdown phase.
